   From Koch, chapter 6
   Models the potential across the membrane over time by specifying changes in each of several ion currents:  Na, K, and a ‘leak’ current (generally used to make the resting potential come out right)
   Potentially tricky bits:
   This model specifies reversal potentials (E_x) relative to resting potential; others use absolute values.
   Slightly different equations/parameters used in different texts (e.g. Dayan).  Also typos are common.
   Assumes temperature of 6.3 deg C; rates need to be adjusted for different temperatures.
   
   This part does not specify sizes, which means V and I really represent voltage/current DENSITIES.
   Alternatively, one can imagine this represents a 1 cm^2 compartment.
   
   For full usability as a Xyce device, we need to specify the units of all the constants, so they can be scaled correctly. Xyce expects SI units: Volts, amps, Farads, etc.
   
   Models a Hodgkin-Huxley compartment fully as well as a Hodgkin-Huxley point neuron.
