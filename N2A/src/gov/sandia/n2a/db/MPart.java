/**
    Collates models following all the N2A language rules, and provides an interface
    for active editing. Also suitable for construction of EquationSets for execution.
    Implements the full MNode interface on the collated tree, as if it were nothing
    more than a regular MNode tree. Changes made through this interface cause changes
    in the original top-level document that would otherwise produce the resulting tree.
    Additional functions (outside the main MNode interface) support efficient
    construction.

    All MNode functions are fully supported. In particular, merge() is safe to use, even
    if it involves $inherit lines.

    See notes on MNode regarding "undefined" nodes. A value of undefined in a top-level
    document allows an underlying inherited value to show through. This should be used
    only for interior structural nodes, not for leaf nodes. It is possible to set a
    top-level leaf node to null, but this should be immediately followed by setting
    children or a value.
